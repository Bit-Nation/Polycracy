# Polycracy

A decision making system for [Polytopians](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/polytopian) to achieve a Polytopian state through the active implementation of a Polycracy descision making mechanism.

A descision making mechanism for Polytopians based on a tailored remix of ideas from Holocracy, Panarchy and the "Agency over Voice" stance. I.e. it's more important to have the agency to make your own descisions, rather than the ability to try to force your opinion onto others.

In short, the ability to choose your own code of law, your own enforcement mechanism, your own descision making mechanism, and everything else central to self-sovreignity within a group of people.

People can vote with their feet, with their wallet, or in the case of Pangea, with the click of a button on their smart phone. No need for consensus, autocracy, or democracy - or other opressive systems which favours voice over agency.
