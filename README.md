# Polycracy

A decision making system for [Polytopians](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/polytopian)

A descision making mechanism for Polytopians based on a tailored remix of ideas from Holocracy, Panarchy and the "Exit over Voice" stance.

In short, the ability to choose your own code of law, your own enforcement mechanism, your own descision making mechanism, and everything else central to self-sovreignity within a group of people.

People can vote with their feet, with their wallet, or in the case of Pangea, with the click of a button on their smart phone. No need for consensus, autocracy, or democracy - or other opressive systems.
